### Milestone 1
- Repo name 1: laravel-api (project should start from the current state of the repo where you created the relationships).
- Add a new Api/ProjectController to our Laravel project. This controller will respond to API requests and return the list of projects in the database in json format.
### Milestone 2
- Test the API call via Postman and make sure we receive the data correctly.
### Milestone 3
- Repo name 2: vite-boolfolio
- Begin working on the front-office part of our application: create a new Vue 3 project with Vite and install axios.
- Connect this project to a separate repo.
### Milestone 4
- In the main component of our Vue App, make an API call to the endpoint built in the Laravel project (milestone 1) and retrieve all projects from our back-end.
- Log the results in the console and verify that we receive the data correctly.
### Bonus
- Create a new component, ProjectCard, which represents a card to display a project.
- Use this component to display all projects received via API.
